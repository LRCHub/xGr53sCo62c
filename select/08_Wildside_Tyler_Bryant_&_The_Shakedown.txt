I need to stay here like I need a hole in the heart
I'm sick of running circles, taking shots in the dark
I feel trapped inside, so I bottled it up
I took a good pill and it burned enough
For me to step on out and cross the line
I've been feeling dead, I wanna feel alive
And throw away my wasted days
Tear the rearview off and let 'em fade

Lookin' straight into the eye of the wildside
Yeah I wanna get mine
No time for goodbyes
Never look back, never look back
Straight into thе eye of the wildsidе
Yeah I wanna get mine
No time for goodbyes
Never look back, never look back
Straight into the eye of the wildside

Well everybody I knew, they didn't know me
I was on the outside and they couldn't see
The dark clouds up there for every black sheep
On a blast, outcast from society
Wasn't born to fit inside a box
Wasn't born to hush, I was born to rock
And kick down the doors you said were locked
And i dare you to make me stop

Lookin' straight into the eye of the wildside
Yeah I wanna get mine
No time for goodbyes
Never look back, never look back
Straight into the eye of the wildside
Yeah I wanna get mine
No time for goodbyes
Never look back, never look back
Straight into the eye
Lookin' straight into the eye of the wildside

Lookin' straight into the eye of the wildside
Yeah I wanna get mine
No time for goodbyes
Never look back
Lookin' straight into the eye of the wildside
Yeah I wanna get mine
No time for goodbyes
Never look back, never look back
Straight into the eye of the wildside
Yeah I wanna get mine
No time for goodbyes
Never look back, never look back
Straight into the eye
Lookin' straight into the eye of the wildside
